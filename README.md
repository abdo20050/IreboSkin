## Getting started
There is few things you need it to get installed before starting the setup, **\*Unfortunately it is only applicable on windows machines\*** 
_all the files and softwares here are Free and Opensource:_
1. [Lively Wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/) for the live disktop wallpaper
   - [The Wallpaper I used in the demo](https://www.deviantart.com/rocksdanister/art/Landscape-833227357) _(log in required to download)_
2. [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net) to install the skin.

## How to install

* Step 0: Your Desktop should be completely **Empty** *(Advise you to use win start menue for software shortcuts or use any desktop organiser)* and then Change your Wallpaper to **Solid Black** *(you'll know why in comming steps)*.
* Step 1: Open lively and go to TYPE tab then choose "Lively .zip" then browse the wallpaper you downloaded ealier then setup it from LIBRARY tab. The wallpaper will be applied  but it has no control on your taskbar or window frame like native win wallpaper so to control them change the the win wallpaper solid color.  
* Step 2: Go to where you downloaded the IreboS and double click to install it and brawallah here it is.
* Extra Steps: To change wheather location and fix the music visualisation follow the sections below.
## How to change weather location
* Go to weahter panal and right click and choose "change weather location" and follow text file then refresh the skin

## How to fix music visualization
To fix it you'll need to follow that [link](https://github.com/marcopixel/Monstercat-Visualizer/wiki/WebNowPlaying-Spotify). *(It's easy just step by step porcedures)*.  
To make it works with browser install [WebNowPlaying](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) extension on your browser with causion because it's kinda buggy and old.

## Bugs that U might counter!!
yes there some bugs in the Skin that you have to consider

1. Whether panel is blank:
   * That is happening because of two reasons:
     1. There is not internet connection.
     2. It's depending on what called HTTPS request so it sometimes happen to reject that request whether for overwhelming requests or anything else so to solve is pretty simple , just exit Rainmeter and wait few seconds and reopen it :)
2. I'm Facing so much Lagging and crashing:
   * Unfortunately my skin isn't the friendliest system resources *yet*, so here is some tips for you for smooth run:
      1. Turn "use hardware acceleration" from rainmeter sittings and restart it.
      2. If you're doing heavy stuff like gaming or rendering so use GameMode from rainmeter which is a quick way to disable the skin.
      3. It's optional for low specs PCs to unload the visiualisation bars or waves because it's the most consuming components in the skin. *(right click -> unload skin)*
      4. Layout(1) is more system friendly than layout(2).
3. Cover Art stop displaying:
   * It wouldn't be a common problem but it could happen , so here how to solve it easily:
      1. Make sure that your spotify is the spotify software and not the app from win10 store.
      2. Open the PowerShell and type 
         >spicetify backup apply
4. Not all components resize when changing the Dpi:
   * Actually that is a problem still hasn't been solved *yet*, so just keep it on the default Dpi.
4. Some panels or skins doesn't work correctly:
   * Yeah some skins need to Update so pls consider [contributing](https://github.com/abdo20050/IreboSkin/blob/master/README.md#to-contribute) because it is a hard work :)
